env
======

Whether you were shouldering me while I was debugging an issue, or caught a glimpse of my computer screen with your peripheral vision, you probably noticed my pimped out vim color scheme and multiple tmux sessions. Setting up your environment should never be a painful process, and if you like how you see things set up in my environment here's an easy way to have it in yours.
